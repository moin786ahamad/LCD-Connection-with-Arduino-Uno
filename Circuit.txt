Before wiring the LCD screen to your Arduino or Genuino board we suggest to solder a Male pin header strip to the 14 (or 16) pin count connector of the LCD screen.
To wire your LCD screen to your board, connect the following pins:

LCD RS pin to digital pin 12
LCD Enable pin to digital pin 11
LCD D4 pin to digital pin 5
LCD D5 pin to digital pin 4
LCD D6 pin to digital pin 3
LCD D7 pin to digital pin 2
Additionally, wire a 10k potentiometer to +5V and GND, with it's wiper (output) to LCD screens VO pin (pin3). A 220 ohm resistor is used to power the backlight of the display, usually on pin 15 and 16 of the LCD connector
